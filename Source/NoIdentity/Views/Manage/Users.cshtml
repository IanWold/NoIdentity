@model List<NoIdentity.Business.User>
@*
    Perhaps there's a bit of confusion here; my model for a user is called "User", and there's also a "User" object in the HttpContext you have access to in the code below.
    I've fully qualified the model name here (though it's not necessary).
    You should probably name your user model something other than "User".
